# introducing, ClippyGPT

Hi everybody! It's my pleasure to announce a first update to **ClippyGPT**!

ClippyGPT is a 'program' made entirely by stringing together an assortment of PowerShell scripts to simulate authentic Clippy popups. ClippyGPT is integrated in the terminal and can connect to OpenAI APIs so that you can chat directly with ChatGPT from the terminal line!

Simply type, 'clippy', followed by a prompt for ChatGPT, and ChatGPT will respond in-character! I am also implementing a few pre-defined commands (e.g., 'clippy weather', 'clippy time') and integration of existing modules and aliases.

I will not skirt around the elephant in the room: this project is **cursed af**. Nobody should use this. Aside from the security concerns surrounding running a "PowerShell program", the program is not meant to be much of a serious endevour. If scripting out these frameworks doesn't end up being too bad then perhaps I will be able to implement a "game loop" and "event handler" as I originally envisioned. More to come...
