# project updates

I thought I should check in and give a proper update on what I've been working on, instead of just hinting vaguely at 'projects.' Truth be told, I don't have much coding experience. Back in 2016, I took a stab at learning C++ by reading Bjarne Stroustrup's book, *The C++ Programming Language*. I got pretty far, and I had a blast, but I fell off the wagon around the time I landed a new job as a tax collections officer-I was unemployed at the time. Funny enough, I'm unemployed now too. Maybe that's why I'm drawn back to coding.
