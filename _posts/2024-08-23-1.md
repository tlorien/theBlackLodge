If you're reading this, then it means that my latest project was a success! Yay! It took the better part of the day, and whether or not that was an appropriate use of my time remains to be seen... The project is a Python tool that automates the creation and secure uploading of blog posts to a GitHub repository, featuring encrypted token management and automatic file name incrementing (to prevent overwrites and adhere to the structure of my blog). The script utilizes GitHub tokens, which are securely stored as an encrypted user variable. [Check it out on GitHub here!](https://github.com/tlorien/GitHub-Pages-Blogger)
