# if you're reading this...

...then it means that my latest project was a success! Yay! It took the better part of the day, and whether or not that was an appropriate use of my time remains to be seen... The project is a Python tool that automates the creation and secure uploading of blog posts to a GitHub repository, featuring encrypted token management and automatic file name incrementing (to prevent overwrites and adhere to the structure of my blog). The script utilizes GitHub tokens, which are securely stored as an encrypted user variable. [Check it out on GitHub here!](https://github.com/tlorien/GitHub-Pages-Blogger)

I'm realizing now that I need a better pipeline for uploading projects to the website. Perhaps an addition to the program? As much fun as I'm having, web design is coming out to be a lot more time consuming and distracting than I initially anticipated.

Anyway, I suppose that it's time I get back to important stuff. I hope to provide updates soon, but that assumes I don't get distracted.
