# thoughts on fingerprinting

I often find myself wondering-and, in the process, avoiding work-if a suite of userscripts could effectively intercept fingerprinting techniques by returning a fake set of values. If these scripts were configured to mimic a common setup, such as a standard Windows installation, and if enough people used them, it could help disguise a significant number of users. Something I'd be interested in looking into further. Perhaps another distraction.
