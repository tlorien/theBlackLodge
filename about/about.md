# About {{ site.author }}

Welcome to theBlackLodge, a personal sanctuary where the worlds of technology, creativity, and introspection converge. I'm {{ site.author }}, a coder, artist, and contemplative thinker enchanted by the complex dance between the digital and the abstract. I've not been coding for very long, but I've always been a tinkerer. Follow me as I create and learn on my journey into software development.

The name "theBlackLodge" draws inspiration from the enigmatic, otherworldly dimension in the cult favorite TV series, *Twin Peaks*. This blog aims to be a portal for exploring the surreal and the profound, and the boundaries between reality and dreams.

Thank you for visiting my about page, and I look forward to connecting with you!

# My Journey in Code and Creativity

Initially, I began my career outside the tech world, working as an electrician and a collections officer. Despite lacking a formal background in coding, my lifelong passion for creating—whether through making videos, writing, or coding—eventually led me to pursue a self-directed path toward a Computer Science degree.

I've always harbored a deep passion for the arts—whether it be music, video, or writing, and this blog will be my playground and workspace, where I'll share everything from detailed coding tutorials to my personal projects in art and software development.

# Why I Blog

In today's world of fleeting social media interactions, I created this blog to foster a deeper, more meaningful connection to the world, my work, and myself. It’s not merely about sharing knowledge; it's about documenting my journey and engaging with a community that values thoughtful dialogue and mutual growth.

Stay tuned for more updates, and thanks for visiting **theBlackLodge**.
